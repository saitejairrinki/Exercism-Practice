**Blog: How to Secure Your Nginx Server with SSL/TLS Certificates**

In today's digital landscape, ensuring the security and privacy of online communications is of paramount importance. As an essential part of this endeavor, setting up SSL/TLS certificates on your web server is crucial. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the steps to secure your Nginx server using SSL/TLS certificates.

**Document: Setting Up SSL/TLS Certificates for Nginx**

Nginx is a powerful and widely-used web server that can serve as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and more. One of its key features is its ability to provide secure communication over the internet using SSL/TLS certificates. In this document, we will walk through the process of setting up SSL/TLS certificates for an Nginx server running on a Unix-like system.

**Step 1: Creating SSL Directory and Configuration**

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the Nginx configuration directory:
   ```
   cd /etc/nginx
   ```

3. Create a directory named `ssl` to store SSL-related files:
   ```
   sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
   ```

4. Move into the newly created directory:
   ```
   cd ssl
   ```

5. Create a text file named `ssl-info.txt` and open it for editing using the `vi` text editor:
   ```
   sudo vi ssl-info.txt
   ```

6. Paste the following code into the `ssl-info.txt` file:
   ```
   [req]
   default_bits       = 2048
   prompt             = no
   default_keyfile    = localhost.key
   distinguished_name = dn
   req_extensions     = req_ext
   x509_extensions    = v3_ca

   [dn]
   C  = PH
   ST = NCR
   L  = Manila
   O  = localhost
   OU = Development
   CN = localhost

   [req_ext]
   subjectAltName = @alt_names

   [v3_ca]
   subjectAltName = @alt_names

   [alt_names]
   DNS.1 = localhost
   DNS.2 = 127.0.0.1
   ```

7. Generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate using the `openssl` command:
   ```
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3652 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx.key -out nginx.crt -config ssl-info.txt
   ```

**Step 2: Configuring Nginx**

1. Navigate to the `sites-available` directory within the Nginx configuration directory:
   ```
   cd ../sites-available
   ```

2. Create a backup copy of the default site configuration file:
   ```
   cp default default.bak
   ```

3. Open the default site configuration file for editing using the `vi` text editor:
   ```
   sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

4. Within the configuration file, find the lines that specify the SSL configuration and replace them with the following:
   ```
   listen 443 ssl http2;
   listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

   ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;

   ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;
   ```

5. After making the necessary changes, ensure that your server block now looks something like this:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80 default_server;
       listen [::]:80 default_server;
       
       # Other server configuration directives
       
       # SSL configuration
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
       ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;
       ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;

       # Other SSL-related directives
       
       # Further server configuration
   }
   ```

**Step 3: Reloading Nginx**

1. Save and close the configuration file.

2. Reload Nginx to apply the changes:
   ```
   sudo service nginx reload
   ```

This completes the process of setting up SSL/TLS certificates for your Nginx server. With the newly configured SSL certificate, your server will now be able to securely serve content over HTTPS.

For more advanced configurations, including enabling stronger encryption protocols and utilizing certificate chains, it's recommended to refer to the official Nginx documentation.
